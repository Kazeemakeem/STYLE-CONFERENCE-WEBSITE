								<h3>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h3>

								<p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>

								<p>In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>

								<h3>ABOUT AARON</h3>

								<p id="last">Aaron Irizarry is a Senior Product Designer for Nasdaq OMX, a lover of heavy metal, a foodie, and a master of BBQ arts.

								<h3>LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKER</h3>

								<p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.</p>

								<p>With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>

								<h3>ABOUT ADAM</h3>

								<p id="last">Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to create effective and easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no matter how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key to its success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at <a href="adamconnor.com">adamconnor.com</a> and <a href="discussingdesign.com.">discussingdesign.com.</a></p>

								<h3>DEATH TO WIREFRAMES: LONG LIVE RAPID PROTOTYPING</h3>

								<p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</p>

								<h3>ABOUT BERMON</h3>

								<h3>WHAT DESIGNERS AND STRATEGISTS CAN LEARN FROM DICK FOSBURY</h3>

								<p>Dick Fosbury is an American track and field athlete who challenged the conventional approach to the high jump with an unorthodox &#8220;back first&#8221; technique that became known as the Fosbury Flop. His innovative approach to a sport that seemed to have reached its limits was ridiculed at first, with sportswriters labeling him &#8220;the world&#8217;s laziest high jumper&#8221; &#8212; but today variations of the Fosbury Flop are used by almost every high jumper.</p>

		            <p>We need to challenge conventions, too. Many of the design conventions used in web, mobile and device interfaces have evolved from systems and processes that no longer connect with our audiences&#8217; realities: a floppy disk as a metaphor to &#8220;save&#8221; information, push buttons as control devices and typography standards derived from mechanical typesetting.</p>

		            <p>As designers and strategists, we need to think like Dick Fosbury, to deconstruct analogues, and to free ourselves from outdated ideas so that we can develop the new interfaces and interactions of the future.</p>


								<h3>ABOUT BRAD</h3>

								<p id="last">Brad Smith is executive director for WebVisions, a conference that explores the future of the web. Most recently he launched &#8220;The Institute for Social Good,&#8221; an organization that connects non-profits with volunteers willing to spend a day building awesome web and mobile apps to change the world for the better.</p>

								<h3>THE BUSINESS OF PLAY</h3>

								<p>Play isn’t just for kids and heavy gamers. Anyone with a Foursquare account knows that &ndash; and the stickiness of a badge and a leaderboard. But a good, playful user experience isn’t about those surface elements either – it’s about creating an environment with well-understood rules, meaningful objectives, and a sense of fun. Whether you’re trying to encourage people &ndash; or yourself &ndash; to save money or to lose weight, a focus on game mechanics and play could be the trump card you’re looking for.</p>

								<h3>ABOUT CAROLYN</h3>

								<p>In this unconventional talk, Chris Mills will encourage you to pick up some drum sticks in addition to your laptop, and beat out a rhythm of learning &#8211; both of code and drum beats! You&#8217;ll learn basic JavaScript and CSS, plus beginner&#8217;s heavy metal drum patterns. The two are a marriage made in heaven, as nothing is a better antidote to code frustration than beating seven shades of **** out of a drum kit.</p>

								<h3>WHAT DISNEY CAN TEACH YOU ABOUT USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN</h3>

								<p>From the creation of the 1937 film <cite>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</cite>, to newer animated films such as <cite>The Princess and the Frog</cite>, to the branded &#8220;Wonderful World of Disney&#8221; itself, the Disney empire has been built upon a design ecosystem. Each film, theme park, or cruise shares a holistic view of a perfect world across time and cultures. Within each experience, the same beloved character traits are highlighted, similar visual and animation styles are used, and the same story and musical techniques are leveraged to bring the audience to an emotional place. This helps make the user experience familiar and nostalgic, and lightens the audience&#8217;s cognitive load to promote enjoyment. Join Erica as she highlights Disney&#8217;s user experience techniques and outlines how you can use them to design an ecosystem that will leave behind a lasting legacy, even while waiting in an extremely long line.</p>

		            <h3>About Erica</h3>

		            <p>Talk abstract: As our websites, applications and teams grow larger and more complicated, so does our CSS. Before we know it, we find ourselves no longer with cute little stylesheets, but sprawling, surly teenaged CSS that doesn&#8217;t always play nice with others. We need to learn how to manage and optimize our CSS no matter how large the project or diverse the team. If we start early, we can use best practices and tools to raise full-grown stylesheets any designer or developer would be happy to work with.</p>

		            <p>That first client meeting may not feel as warm and fulfilling as the first time you hold your newborn child, but consider the similarities.</p>

		            <p>You know each other but have never met. As the relationship grows you will have to rely on your experiences and education to gently guide them while allowing flexibility for projects to change and evolve. It&#8217;s not your job to control everything, but if you are successful you will create a well-rounded piece that everyone involved can love.</p>

		            <h3>ABOUT JENIFER</h3>

		            <h3>DESIGNING TO LEARN</h3>

		            <p>We&#8217;ve reached a point where non-designers understand the value of design. This has led to an increase in demand for design talent. In the past, we would have turned to institutions of higher education to help us find new talent; however, today&#8217;s graduates often finish school without the skills they need to thrive in a professional design setting.</p>

		            <p>There is a massive gap between what students learn and what industry needs. This skills gap leaves graduates unable to find jobs and hiring companies unable to find talent. How we approach this challenge will affect the continued relevance and value of design.</p>

		            <p>Jim Henson started working as a puppeteer in 1954, a fair 40-50 years before many of us even considered User Experience as a career. He did, however, take it upon himself to apply many of the core principles that UX Designers are falling love with today (or are at least using as part of our everyday lives). Hang out for a quick dive into the life of Jim Henson, with a view into his work from the perspective of how it pertains to what it is we&#8217;re doing today, that promises to even leave Waldorf and Statler happy.</p>

		            <h3>Leveling Up with Flexbox</h3>

		            <p>By now, you&#8217;ve probably heard of &#8220;flexbox,&#8221; short for the CSS Flexible Box Layout module and the most fully developed and well supported of CSS3&#8217;s wide array of new layout mechanisms. Flexbox allows you to create fluid, responsive layouts without having to worry about all those pesky float layout quirks we&#8217;ve dealt with for over a decade. But with cross-browser support still incomplete, you&#8217;ve probably relegated flexbox to the &#8220;one day&#8221; pile of web design tricks.</p>

		            <p>It&#8217;s time to stop waiting. In this talk, Zoe aims to convince you that it&#8217;s a good idea to start learning and using flexbox today. You&#8217;ll learn how to take your designs—and web design skills—to the next level as we use flexbox as practical progressive enhancement, adding it in bits and pieces on individual page components with graceful fallbacks.</p>
